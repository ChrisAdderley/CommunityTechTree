==========================

This is a community designed tech tree designed to support as many mods as possible and extend the KSP tech tree without affecting the stock tree.

INSTALLATION
============

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so.

It also requires mods to support it for their parts to be added. Modders, see the included ForModders.txt file for how to support the Community Tech Tree with your mod.
